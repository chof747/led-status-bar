## Status bar with RGB Leds

This is a breakout board containing 5 WS2812B compatible RGB Leds that can be used to display some kind of status information or for other presentation stuff

It contains the following elements:

- 5 WS2812B compatible surface mount RGB leds
- A transistor acting as a signal level shifter so it can be triggered by a 3V3 signal while the LEDs are powered by a higher voltage
- By-pass capacitors for each LED according to the data sheets
- A 3-pin header so that it can be connected to VSS (e.g. 5V), GND and a data line
  (1 - VSS, 2- Data, 3 - GND)
